## CoreKit - Minimal C-Header Kit

### What is CoreKit?
CoreKit is a minimal educational C-header kit developed & maintained solely by me (@aobv), this kit includes multiple header files; which can be implemented into your C-project manually.
It provides lightweight, modular components that can be manually integrated into your C projects; no external dependencies or build systems required.

### What is the purpose of CoreKit?
CoreKit was mainly developed for education & experimentation with low-level C programming concepts, data structures, and general-purpose utilities.
It's goal is to offer simple, readable examples of reusable C code that balance clarity, performance, and portability.

### Included Modules:
- Dictionaries
- Vectors

### Future Plans
CoreKit is a WIP and will continue to grow with more headers and examples over time.  
Planned additions include:
- String utilities (`ck_str`)

### Contributing
CoreKit is an educational project, but feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome.  
If you find bugs, have ideas for new modules, or want to help improve existing ones, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
